Week 5 assignment

This app presents the user with a 5-question timed quiz about 80's movies. Correct answers are rewarded with a GIF related to the movie. Features include:

- Objects stored in arrays to allow for easier expansion of questions;
- Dynamically-created buttons;
- A randomizer that shuffles the order of the answer choices so users don't simply remember the location of the correct answer each time;
- A score-keeping display;
- A timer that will default submit an answer as incorrect when it reaches '0';
